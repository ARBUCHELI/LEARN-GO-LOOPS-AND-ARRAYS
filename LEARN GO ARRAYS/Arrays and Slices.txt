# ARRAYS AND SLICES
-------------------

* Introduction to Arrays
------------------------
Imagine we are creating an online gaming platform, and need to keep track of players’ scores. For each player, we’d need to store their score at a consistent index for that player. This 
is a situation in which arrays would come in handy!

An array is a collection of data elements of the same type, where we can access each element by an index. We can think of an array as a row of mailboxes, with each index representing a 
house number.

[0][1][2][3][4][5]

Arrays are one of the most common forms of variables used in programs. We use arrays for tasks such as:

	. Storing many pieces of input

	. Storing related collections of values

	. Performing mathematical operations on lists of numbers

Across the world, arrays are being used in billions of running programs!

Throughout this course, we will introduce and practice using arrays in our programs. Over the next several exercises we will introduce:

	. Creating arrays

	.Accessing array values

	. Using the length of an array

To begin using arrays in our programs, we will first have to create them. We will get started creating arrays in the next exercise.

* Instructions
--------------
Check out and run the code in the workspace and continue on when ready!

arrays.go
---------
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  // Create an array for our 4 player scores.
  var playerScores [4]int
  // Set the first player's score to 43
  playerScores[0] = 43
  // Set the second player's score to 7
  playerScores[1] = 7
  // Set the third player's score to 32
  playerScores[2] = 32
  // Set the fourth player's score to 65
  playerScores[3] = 65
  // Print the scores of all the players!
  fmt.Println(playerScores)
}

* Array Creation
----------------
To use arrays in our programs, we must first declare and name them. In Go, there are a variety of ways in which we can declare an array. In the next few exercises, we will explore methods 
of array creation.

When we declare a variable in Go, the compiler:

	. Finds space in memory for that variable

	. Associates the variable with a name

Using arrays makes the compiler’s job a little more complicated. When we declare a single variable, the compiler needs to find enough space for one of that data type. When we declare an 
array, the compiler is going to have to find enough space for several of a data type.

To make this process simple, declaring an array in Go requires that we provide the number of elements. Once declared, we cannot change this number without declaring a new array. The 
compiler finds enough space for the array’s type, multiplied by the number of elements.

We can create arrays with or without an initial set of elements. We use an array without initial elements when the rest of our program will create the array’s content. To create an array 
without an initial set of elements we use the following syntax:

var playerScores [4]int
fmt.Println(playerScores)
// [0 0 0 0]

This syntax creates an empty array of integer values with space for 4 elements. We could create an array like this and later fill it with values from user input.

While empty arrays are great for storing data we can’t predict, sometimes we already know what we want in our array! In the next exercise, we’ll introduce a way to create an array filled 
with particular values.

First, let’s practice creating an empty array.

* Instructions
--------------
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
Begin by creating an empty array of strings, playerNames with space for 5 elements


Hint
We can create an array of a particular size with syntax like:

var arrayName [numOfElements]type

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Next, print the content of the array you just created. What do you expect to see?


Hint
We can print a variable with fmt.Println

fmt.Println(variable)

arrays.go
---------
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  // Create the array here
  var playerNames [5]string
  fmt.Println(playerNames)
}
